                        Welcome to my portfolio!. < br />
                        <br />< br />
                        Im currently enrolled in a full-stack coding bootcamp at ASU, with an expected graduation date of November 30th, 2023. I come from an extensive background in marketing and sales, and can't wait to bring my years of marketing expertise to the development side.<br /> <br />
                        Currently as my time as a bootcamp student, I've expanded my skillset to include: <br />
                        <br />
                        1. HTML & CSS <br />
                        2. JavaScript <br />
                        3. Node.js <br />
                        4. Express.js <br />
                        5. MySQL <br />
                        6. MongoDB <br />
                        7. React <br />
                        <br /> <br />

                        when im not coding, I enjoy spending time with my fianc√© and two dogs, playing video games, watching sports, and being active lifting or practicing Brazilian Jujitsu.
